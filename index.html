        <b>Dr A P J Abdul Kalam</b>
         History “Dream, dream, dream. Dreams
        transform into thoughts and thoughts result in action.” – A P J Abdul
        Kalam A P J Abdul Kalam - APJ Abdul Kalam History Avul Pakir
        Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born to Jainulabdeen, a boat owner and
        Imam, and Ashiamma, a housewife. Kalam had four brothers and a sister,
        all elder to him. Although Kalam’s ancestors had been wealthy traders,
        the family had descended into difficult times and Kalam used to sell
        newspapers as a child to add-on to his family’s modest income. Kalam
        studied at a school in Ramanathapuram and acquired a degree in Physics
        from Saint Joseph’s College, Tiruchirappalli. In 1955, he went to the
        Madras Institute of Technology to pursue aerospace engineering. His
        dream of becoming a fighter pilot was thwarted when he missed the
        qualifier by a narrow margin. He was ranked ninth but only 8 positions
        were available with the IAF. After that, he got a job as a scientist at
        the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and
        Development Organisation (DRDO). He also worked under eminent scientist
        Vikram Sarabhai. Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research
        Organisation (ISRO) in 1969. At ISRO, he was the Project Director of the
        satellite launch vehicle (SLV) that successfully deployed the satellite
        Rohini into orbit in 1980. It was India’s first SLV. Kalam also worked
        to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). He was also the
        director of two projects, Project Valiant and Project Devil for
        developing ballistic missiles from the SLV technology. His research and
        leadership led him to the directorship of an advanced missile
        development programme. When R Venkataraman was the Defence Minister,
        Kalam was appointed the chief executive of the Integrated Guided Missile
        Development Programme that was a project aimed at developing a fleet of
        missiles. He was known as the ‘Missile Man of India’ for his work in the
        development of ballistic missile technology. From 1992 to 1999, Kalam
        was the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and the Secretary
        of the DRDO. Kalam was the Chief Project Coordinator during the Pokhran
        II tests. During this time, Kalam became India’s best-known scientist.
        In 2002, Abdul Kalam was elected the 11th President of India. He had won
        by a huge margin. He was the first scientist to become India’s President
        and incidentally the first bachelor too. Kalam’s term as the president
        which lasted the full term till 2007 was beneficial for the office of
        the president itself. He came to be called the People’s President. His
        popularity soared among the people, especially school children. He
        visited many parts of the country and his speeches became popular for
        their motivational content. Despite pressure from the people to have him
        stand for a second term, he decided not to contest. After the
        presidency, Kalam became a visiting professor at the IIM Ahmedabad, IIM
        Shillong, IIM Indore, the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, Anna
        University, etc. Abdul Kalam died of a cardiac arrest while giving a
        lecture at the IIM Shillong on 27 July 2015. There was widespread grief
        expressed at his passing away with the government of India declaring a
        7-day state mourning. The governments of various other countries as well
        as the United Nations expressed their grief. He was laid to rest with
        full state honours at his native Rameswaram. Abdul Kalam was a man of
        integrity who was known for his honesty. He left no personal wealth
        after his death barring a few personal possessions which included his
        books, laptop, etc. He was knowledgeable in the teachings of various
        religions and had become a symbol of inter-faith dialogue.
